# Toynbee Hall Datathon

Welcome to the first ever Toynbee Hall datathon!
If you have not registered for this event, please [pop on over to the Eventbrite so we can have an idea of how many people participated!](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/datathon-at-toynbee-hall-tickets-59760759039).
This page has all the information you need to help us make meaningful changes in Tower Hamlets.

## Background

Since our inception in 1884, evidence based research has been central to Toynbee Hallâ€™s mission as a charity. 
Over a century ago we played a key role in creating the first data visualizations mapping poverty in order to help tackle inequalities in London. 
135 years later we are now turning to new technologies to help serve the community we continue to be a part of. 

Continuing in our history of using evidence to build narratives for social change, we thank you for joining us in person or online for an afternoon of analyzing and visualizing publicly available data to help create materials we can use in our mission to advocate for meaningful impacts that will change government policy.

Below, we detail our methods, goals, and provide as much as we can to enable you to help us.

## Context

While you can read more about us on [our website](http://www.toynbeehall.org.uk/), the focus of today's Datathon looking at two separate issues in the Tower Hamlets community:

1. Youth Homelessness.
2. Local Saftey

To give a bit of background information, [Tower Hamlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets) [one of 32 boroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_London_boroughs) in London, England.
Historically, Tower Hamlets has been one of the poorest and underfunded boroughs in all of London.
Despite our lack of financial support compared to other wealthier boroughs, Tower Hamlets is one of the most [culturally diverse areas in all of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets#Demographics).

According to a previous [research project we carried out looking at the needs of older people in Tower Hamlets](http://www.toynbeehall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/You-dont-really-know-people-till-you-talk-to-them-Older-Peoples-Participatory-Action-Research-FINAL-REPORT.pdf), we identified public safety as an issue we needed to address in future work.
That future work is this project.

Our goal here is to identify trends in data, visualize them, and share them in way that they can be leveraged by local charities as part of their literature they used to advocate for change at the Government level.

## The Questions

One of the core skills of any researcher is to be able to finding meaningful answers in vague questions.
In an industry setting, this might be something like "How do we drive more web traffic to our front page?" or "How can we optimize our company's product so that we can increase our profits in the fourth quarter for our shareholders?".

Today our question is "How can we find empirical support in order to demonstrate ____ ?".
In order to help answer this question, we have collected an assortment of data sets from publicly available official sources in order to provide you with the materials to help answer these questions. 
The data sets are found below in [Datasets] along with their original source, as well a few [tidy] versions of the data to help with your time. 

## Your Analysis 

Given the [Datasets] below, we ask that you analyze your data as transparently as possible.
This means:

1. For each visualization, please use a common open source software like R or Python to create your data visualizations.
2. Save each visualization and please produce a commented script that allows your dataviz to be reproduced. This will allow us to expand upon your work, ensure the analyses are reproducible, and will let us at Toynbee Hall edit the visualizations for [House Style] if we adopt your creation in one of our campaigns.
3. If possible, please try to match our [House Style]. 
4. Feel free to share your creation(s) on Twitter with both the #data4toynbee and #tidytuesday hashtags. 
5. You publish your creation under the MIT License. We only ask this so if we do use your analysis or data visualization in our work, we don't run into any legal problems. The license is reproduced below. 

## Datasets

In the table below we list datasets of interest, as well as if we have cleaned them or not. 

* [Crime in London](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary)
* Data and link 2 
* Data and like n 

## House Style

We want to use your work to help advocate for change in Tower Hamlets.
In order for us to do that as efficiently as possible, we eventually will need to format it with our house style.
You of course do not need to submit your data viz with our house style-- one of the big goals of this is to just see what we can learn when we ask for other's help analyzing our data -- but if you would like to follow our house style we use...

* Font: Arial Regular 
* Primary Color
  - Orange (#F58220)
  - Grey (#635466)
* Text
  - Grey (#4C4D4F)
* Secondary Palette 
  - Blue (#175984)
  - Light Blue (#96B4DE)

Eventually we plan to create a similar house package akin to [bbplot](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot), but this has not been created yet. 

## Liscence Agreement 

By participating in our Datathon, we ask that any data visualizations that you create are published under the the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

The licences is reproduced below.

## Thank You and Future Work 

We want to thank you for the work that you are doing for us and our community.
If you would like your name to be added to the report that will emerge from this project, please add your name to the Google Form below.
This will allow us to include your name in the report.

One of the other goals in this Datathon is creating a network of data analysts that are willing to help with future work.
Unlike much of the start up, tech, machine learning world, many non-profits and charities do not have or even need the latest machine learning in order to be effective in our goals.
What we do need is people who can create clear, clean meaningful analyses to help build narratives to mobile social change.
If you enjoyed this and would like to be contacted for future small and similar requests, please indicate that on the form below.

One of our goals is to use our infrastructure in order to build up a network where we can use data for good to help those that need it.
